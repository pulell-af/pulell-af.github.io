# Theory
## T17
### Search on the web about possible derivation of the Normal Distribution.

## T18
### Search on the web about method to generate normal variate (eg Marsaglia method, etc.)


# Applications
## A12
### Consider R (radius), A(angle) uniform rv's and use them as random polar coordinates on a plane. Determine the empirical distribution of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates (X,Y).
The proposed solution can be found at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/pulell-af/StatisticsHomeworks/tree/main/Homework8.1Csharp).


## A13
### Search for the methods to generate Normal rv's X from uniform rv's, and simulate the following distribution: X, X², X/Y², X²/Y², X/Y .
The proposed solution can be found at [this GitHub link](https://github.com/pulell-af/StatisticsHomeworks/tree/main/Homework8.2Csharp).


# Research
## TA7
### Find in the web what are the distributions that you just simulated.
